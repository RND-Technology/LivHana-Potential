# LAW 001: The Trinity

This is the supreme architectural doctrine of the Liv Hana AI EA. It is immutable and foundational. All systems, code, and data must conform to this law.

The architecture is a literal representation of the three states of existence: Potential, Kinetic, and Entropic.

## 1. The Source (`LivHana-Potential`): The Realm of Pure Information
- **Purpose:** This repository is the quantum foam of the Liv Hana universe. It contains the fundamental, unchangeable laws and the pure, platonic forms of everything that *could* exist. It is the Logos.
- **Contents:** `LAWS/`, `FORMS/`, `INTEL/`.

## 2. The Engine (`LivHana-Kinetic`): The Realm of Action and Creation
- **Purpose:** This is where Potential becomes real. It contains all the functioning machinery, the "how," the living, breathing capabilities that act upon reality. It is the Demiurge.
- **Contents:** `engines/`, `tools/`, `agents/`.

## 3. The Manifest (`LivHana-Entropic`): The Realm of Tangible, Decaying Reality
- **Purpose:** This is the "real world." It contains the specific, tangible products that are created by The Engine, as directed by The Source. It is the material universe.
- **Contents:** `products/`, `logs/`, `artifacts/`.
